=============

- Clone the repo

to do
=========================

- Speed it up, it's currently massively slow and inefficient.
- Improve configuration.
- Rank by age (oldest at the top).
- Change colour of pull request according to age.
- Add a way of resizing items according to how  many there are, so that it can fit them all on the screen at once.
